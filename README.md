# Heart-Failure-clinical-record-analysis
Cardiovascular diseases kill approximately 17 million people globally every year, and they mainly
exhibit as myocardial infarctions and heart failures. Heart failure (HF) occurs when the heart cannot pump enough
blood to meet the needs of the body.
Available electronic medical records of patients quantify symptoms, body features, and clinical laboratory test values,
which can be used to perform biostatistics analysis aimed at highlighting patterns and correlations otherwise
undetectable by medical doctors. Machine learning, in particular, can predict patientsâ€™ survival from their data and can
individuate the most important features among those included in their medical records.(Chicco, Davide & Jurman, Giuseppe. (2020). Machine learning can predict survival of patients with heart failure from serum creatinine and ejection fraction alone. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making. 20. 10.1186/s12911-020-1023-5. )

# In this code we try to analyse dataset of 299 people with heart failure.
we apply multiple ML algorithms to predict the survival and also to find most important features.
